Wrapper Classes in Java:
=========================

Wrapper classes are used to convert primitive data types like int, char,boolean etc. into
objects. 

byte - Byte
short - Short
 int - >  Integer
 char ->  Character
 float -  Float
 double ->Double
 boolean - Boolean
 long - Long
 
 These wrapper classes are useful when working with Collections like ArrayList, LinkedList, 
 LinkedHashSet or HashMap etc. , 
 
 Collections can only store objects, they cannot store primitive types. 
 
 AutoBoxing: 
 Autoboxing is automatic Conversion of a primitive data type to an object type.
 
 AutoUnboxing or Unboxing: 
 Automatic conversion of an object to primitive type.
 It is the reverse process for autoboxing.  - Wrapper class object is automatically
 converted back into its corresponding primitive type.
